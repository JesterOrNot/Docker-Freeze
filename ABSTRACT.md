As referenced on https://github.com/gitpod-io/dockerfreeze/pull/33#issuecomment-594033021 we are expecting following features:

1. Detect Kernel used
2. Detect used File system hierarchy (in case end-user is using ostree or custom)
3. Capture executables from the PATH (or windows path?)
4. GUI/TUI to select the expected configuration
